2. **Handling Missing Values**  
   - Filled missing values in the `Income` column with the median.  
   - Checked other columns for missing data and handled accordingly.  

3. **Standardizing Categorical Columns**  
   - Cleaned and standardized categorical features like `Education` and `Marital Status` for consistency.  

4. **Datetime Conversion**  
   - Converted the `Dt_Customer` column to a proper datetime format for easier time-based analysis.  

5. **Column Renaming**  
   - Renamed all columns to **snake_case** for better readability and Python compatibility.  

6. **Export Cleaned Dataset**  
   - Saved the cleaned dataset as `customer_personality_cleaned.csv`.
